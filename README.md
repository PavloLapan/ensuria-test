# GENERAL INFO

    -for running app - clone, run 'npm i' and then 'npm run dev'

# WHAT WAS DONE
    - Created custom select
    - Added zustand for better operating with data and caching
    - Decomposed data, created correct types abd nicely did fetch) 
    - Custom select have correct behaviour for user events ( blur, focus, hover )
    - Added some ui styles ( not much, scroll like in macOs)
    - Also fixed styling for select was added from a task
    - Options was handled by react-window package, if needed I can create my own virtualized list,
     but api wasn`t rdy for that, I`ve tried to create it with load more bth or when scroll to end of the lsit
    and pass props to api file, but didn`t found config how to do that. Like fetchMore
    - New option returns value to onChange handler to app.tsx
    - Data loaded from api you gave in task

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
